            <p> Swagger is the name he used for his youtube identity and people call him that because no one knows his real name.  He is my hero because he is a comedian and I've always wanted to be a comedian so watching him everyday gives me the courage I need.  Swagger also has a lot of other youtuber friends who inspire me so I love watching them to.  The content that they make really helps me get through the day.  That is why I'm making my tribute to him.
